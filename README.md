# PROG 01: Crunch Time

Calorie Receipt is a calorie conversion and documenting app. Calorie receipt offers
a simple and intuitive design to determine how many calories different activities burn,
what it takes to burn the same amount of calories with different activities, as well as
track groups of past activities with calorie totals.

Calorie receipt uses the Material Design guideline crafted by Google in order to
provide a visually pleasing interface that blends in with the system applications
on Android devices.

produce great looking application. I would also like to thank them for their
icon set, which I use throughout the app.
* I would especially like to thank Stack Overflow for being my guide throughout the
entire development process. I don't think I could do this without their service.
